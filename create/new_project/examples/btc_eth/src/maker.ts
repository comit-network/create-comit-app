/**
 * This executable function represents the maker side during a trade.
 * A trade consists of two phases: negotiation and execution.
 *
 * During the negotiation phase the maker publishes an order that the taker can take.
 * Once the negotiation is over (i.e. the taker has accepted the order) the execution of the swap commences.
 *
 * -- Execution details: --
 * Most of the logic of the swap execution is done by COMIT SDK. The example tells the ComitClient that
 * it wants to execute fund and redeem for a specific swap. The ComitClient checks for the availability of the
 * fund and redeem action in the comit node daemon.
