This project was bootstrapped with [Create Comit App](https://github.com/comit-network/create-comit-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start-env`

This command will take hold of your terminal; to run an application using the environment you will have to use a separate terminal.
To clean up the environment, press `CTRL-C`.

### `yarn start`

Displays the environment variables created during environment set-up.
