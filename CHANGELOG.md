## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Correct log messages in ERC20-BTC example.

### Added
- Updated `btc_eth` example to use the latest comit-js-sdk (0.5.6).
- Added a simple negotiation protocol prototype to the example in `separate_apps`.
- Setting the project name in the `package.json` when running the `new` command.
- Clean up the environment if a panic occurs.
- `force-clean-env` command to stop all services.
- `separate_apps` example where the taker and maker must be started from different terminal to give a better peer-to-peer feeling.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-10-17

### Added
- Deploy an ERC20 contract on the Ethereum node and give tokens to both parties. The address of the token contract is written to the env file as `ERC20_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.

### Changed
- Migrate parts of the code base to async/await :tada:

## [0.2.1] - 2019-10-04

### Added
- Publish create-comit-app on npmjs.com.

### Changed
- Fix the odd initial Ether amount.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-10-04

### Added
- Ensure that all temporary folders are cleaned up when shutting down start-env.
- Display clear message if start-env is started twice on the same machine.

### Changed
- Move start-env env file to `~/.create-comit-app/env` so that the user does not have to start it from inside the project folder.
- If a signal (e.g. CTRL-C) is sent while `start-env` is booting, it waits for the action in progress (e.g., starting docker container) and then stops and properly cleans up the environment. 
- Improve code quality to avoid artifacts remaining after a failure happens while booting start-env.
- Migrate to comit-rs 0.3.0. Only the `cnd` docker is now needed!
- Move the env file from `./.env` to `~/.create-comit-app/env` to improve usability.
- Only pull docker images if they are not present locally, this allows offline usage of the `start-env` command.
